The directory contains several examples using sets. The operations on sets are defined in setlogic.h. The examples test_mutex.. demonstrate how sets can be used to model operations with mutexes to specify the following assertions:
1. Mutex should not be locked twice.
2. Mutex should not be unlocked twice.
3. At the end all mutexes should be released.
The examples follow the SV-COMP rules, they use __VERIFIER_error, __VERIFIER_assume, __VERIFIER_nondet_int functions.
The suffix true-unreach-call means that the ideal verdict is SAFE, and false-unreach-call means UNSAFE.
