The benchmarks in this directory were generated
by Martin Spiessl based on the tasks in the nla-digbench folder,
which were originally were submitted by
ThanhVu Nguyen (tnguyen@cse.unl.edu) and
Timos Antonopoulos (timos.antonopoulos@yale.edu).

As such, we apply the same license.

The tasks can easily be generated again by calling `make tasks`,
which will call the script `generate.py` in this directory.
This script is also published under the same license as the benchmark tasks.
