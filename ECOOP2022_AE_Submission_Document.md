# Artifact Submission Template

Please answer the following questions concisely, either with bullet lists or short paragraphs.

Title of the submitted paper: Concolic Execution for WebAssembly
ECOOP submission number for the paper: 25

## Overview: What does the artifact comprise?

Please list for each distinct component of your artifact:

* what type of artifact (data, code, proof, etc.) 
* in which format (e.g., CSV, source code, binary, etc.)
* can be found in which location
* Which badges do you claim for your artifact?  
  Please indicate whether you claim the functional, reusable, and/or available badges. Note that an artifact that is claimed to fulfill the criteria of the reusable badge must fulfill the criteria for the functional badge as well and, if it does, both badges will be awarded. Please refer to the submission and review guidelines for the criteria for each badge.

## For authors claiming a functional or reusable badge: What are claims about the artifact’s functionality to be evaluated by the committee?

* Which data or conclusions from the paper are generated/supported by the artifact components?
* Which activities described in the paper have led to the creation of the artifact components?
* What is the functionality/purpose of the artifact (in case it goes beyond answering the previous 2 questions)? 

Please provide explicit references that link processes, data, or conclusions in the paper with the location of the supporting component in the artifact, e.g., 

* “The data in table 1 can be obtained by running script ‘abc.sh’ on the data at ‘/home/anonymous/input_data.csv’”
* “Performing the described literature analysis on all articles listed in /home/anonymous/papers.csv led to the classification in /home/anonymous/papers_tagged.json”

## For authors claiming a reusable badge: What are the authors' claims about the artifact's reusability to be evaluated by the committee?

Please list any reuse scenarios that you envision for your artifact, i.e., state how the artifact can be reused or repurposed beyond its role in the submitted paper. Example:

* “The implementation can easily be modified to use a different algorithm than the one described in section 4.1 of our paper by implementing a corresponding module. We provide an interface specification in ...”

## For authors claiming an available badge

We offer to publish the artifact on [DARTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/institut_darts.php), in which case the available badge will be issued automatically.
If you agree to publishing your artifact under a Creative Commons license, please indicate this here.

In case you would like to publish your artifact under different conditions, please provide the following information.

* On which platform will the artifact be made publicly available?
* Please provide a link to the platform’s retention policy (not required for DARTS, Zenodo, FigShare).
* Under which license will the artifact be published?
