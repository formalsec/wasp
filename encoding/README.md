Encoding serves as an abstracted constraint-solving wrapper, currently 
utilising Z3 as its backend solver. However, future plans for Encoding 
include support for other solvers in its backend, such as CVC5.

## Build from source

```

- Then, install the library dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wasp-platform/encoding.git
cd encoding
opam install . --deps-only
```

- Build and test:

```sh
make
make test
```

- Install `encoding` on your path by running:
